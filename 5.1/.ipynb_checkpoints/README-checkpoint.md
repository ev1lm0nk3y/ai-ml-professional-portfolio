# 5.1: Coupon Acceptance Analysis

In this assignment, we are asked to take some survey data regarding coupons
delivered to drivers as they near various establishments.

The [completed notebook](./assignment.ipynb) works through the exercises to get
familiar with data cleaning and general querying and plotting. The final
exercise was to take this learning and use the techniques on some other coupon
type. I have chosen to analyze the less expensive restaurant coupon `Restaurant(<20)`. 

Most graphs have been saved as images in the `images/` directory and many Plotly
images have been saved as html in the `html/` directory.
